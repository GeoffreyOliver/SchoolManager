		<p> A palette is a group of form fields which are required to edit a record. A palette typically does not include all columns of a table but only the ones that belong to a particular module or content element. Palettes can change dynamically depending on the user's permissions or type of element and certain subparts of the form (called subpalettes) can be loaded interactively via Ajax.
		The image resizing function lets you resize the original image, create a copy (with or without resizing), or create a thumbnail image.
		For practical purposes there is no difference between creating a copy and creating a thumbnail except a thumb will have the thumbnail marker as part of the name (ie, mypic_thumb.jpg).
		All preferences listed in the table above are available for this function except these three: rotation_angle, x_axis, and y_axis.
		The newsletter extension allows you to manage and send newsletters and optionally display them on the website. Unlike articles that are associated with a particular page, newsletters are organized in channels, which allows you to easily group or categorize them.</p>
